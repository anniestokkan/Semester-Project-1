        <p class="involved-text">Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history, science has
            developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
            <p class="involved-text2">The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
                experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
                passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>
                <p class="involved-text2">We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,
                    but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
                    exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits
                    are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
                    (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

            <p class="text-explore">There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are
                an important way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community. You can also support us
                by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some item or collection that you
                think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will be able
                to assist you.</p>

            <p class="text-explore">A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order
                and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
                scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers
                come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
              <p class="text-explore2">
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more
                about how you can get involved.</p>

                sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship
                at the museum.</p>
                <p class="text-explore2">You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are
                    passionate about science and sharing it with the wider community.</p>
